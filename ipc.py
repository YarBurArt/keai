Fast inter-process communication (ipc) for Python (CPython, PyPy, 2.7, 3.6+) on MS-Windows.
It uses shared memory and eventing.
Example rpc style synchronization:
Server (rpc provider):
    import ipc
    ipc_context = ipc.IpcContext('MySecret')
    ipc_context.wait()
    while True:
        message = ipc_context.read_data()
        do_something_important(message)
        ipc_context.signal_then_wait()
Client (consumer, does not read data in this example):
    import ipc
    ipc_context = ipc.IpcContext('MySecret')
    while True:
        message = some_important_message()
        context.send_data_then_wait(message)
A possible alternative is named pipes, see for example https://github.com/mark3982/pywpipe
