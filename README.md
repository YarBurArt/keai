# Keai /
This project is practically a friend of mine, with a similar character in speech. The conditional ayanami ray can see me, make out my face and hand gestures, and recognise my voice. And then she can respond to me with her voice and show her emotions in a gif.

## Instalation /
```
git clone https://github.com/YarBurArt/keai.git
cd keai
virtualenv venv
```

for linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

for windows: `venv/Scripts/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Be careful, some packages weigh a lot of gigabytes.

## Run it /

The project is still under active development, not everything has been realised yet, let alone optimised. Here is a guide on how it should work.

(venv) `python3 manager.py` 

OR

Use the individual functions from these files: `handrec.py` , `emorec.py` , `spr2.py` , `imgshow.py` , `autopc.py`

## How it works / 

Files: `handrec.py` , `emorec.py` and `spr2.py` receives data from the camera and microphone and transmits it to the manager. 
The manager, based on the ai, triggers a response in the files: `imgshow.py` and `autopc.py`

The code snippets presented here are intended for eventual integration into a larger program. 
The project would involve developing sophisticated neural networks that can create a highly immersive virtual reality environment, where humans can experience an artificial world that feels just like the real one. The neural networks would be designed to replicate the complex workings of the human speech and its ability to process sensory information, create memories, and generate thoughts and emotions.
In addition to providing an escape from the physical world, the project would also aim to achieve "conditional immortality" through the use of multiple neural networks. These networks would be designed to store and replicate human memories and thought patterns, creating a digital version of the person's mind that could exist indefinitely in the virtual world. You can, for example, communicate with dead people. Neural networks can create a new kind of person...
