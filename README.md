# Keai /
This project is practically a friend of mine, with a similar character in speech. The conditional ayanami ray can see me, make out my face and hand gestures, and recognise my voice. And then she can respond to me with her voice and show her emotions in a gif.

## Description /

The code snippets presented here are intended for eventual integration into a larger program. The number of actions required for installation may seem daunting, and even with a detailed installation guide, one may still encounter difficulties. 

However, the process of experimentation and customization is often necessary when working with the intricacies of Linux programming. With perseverance and a willingness to explore, one can harness the power of this dark art to achieve their desired results 

It is important to note that the code presented here is not intended for use by those unfamiliar with Linux programming. It is recommended that those without experience seek the guidance of a more experienced programmer or technician. With proper guidance, however, even those new to Linux programming can learn to navigate and utilize its capabilities.
